This is a simple demo using akka actors. We have two types of actors:

* BoardActor is an actor for a game board
* PlayerActor is an actor for a player

To run it, execute BoardActor.run - which will start a remote actor for the board. After that, execute PlayerActor.run("playername") for each player you want to have. This will start a player actor, and a Scala Swing screen for the game area.

Please keep in mind this is just a simple demo, not a full fledged game... but it can become this in the future =)
